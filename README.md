# IoT-Based_Smart_Plant_Monitoring_System-
Hardware based project

In the agriculture sector, our IoT Based Smart Plant Monitoring System can provide solution to revolutionize plant care methods. Our system addresses by integrating a network of sensors, including those for temperature, humidity, and soil moisture. These sensors communicate with microcontrollers, such as Arduino, creating a robust ecosystem capable of continuously collecting real time data from the plant environment.
